            <p>Many financial consumers view the super-sized, mass advice financial companies with distrust, disappointment and resignation. Their experience of having an endless series of cross-sold consumer products and sales ideas of the month pushed their way has left them wondering, who’s interest is really first?  In considering the companies, it can seem like the choices are limited to marginal differences, so a relationship decision is often made simply on the personality of the local sales person.  The mega-companies‘  mass delivery of their chocolate, vanilla or strawberry options  has left many doubting their current strategy and deeply concerned about their financial security. But, the options seem as limited as choosing between a Granny Smith or a Pink Lady apple, slightly different taste but still apples. What can one do in an apples to apples world? Pick a different fruit.</p>

            <p> At Kumquat, we move beyond the stale delivery of mass advice to vibrant personalized planning and execution.

            comprehensive, consistent solutions. At Kumquat,
